# Ansible playbooks for Vagrant

These are some of the [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/home) playbooks that I've been using to make [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) boxes for different types of projects. Each directory will contain a basic Vagrantfile, and a provisioning directory containing an [Ansible playbook](http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks.html) for setting up the Vagrant box. You can read more information about the specific project in the README located inside each directory.

### Prerequisites

* Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
* Install [Vagrant](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/).
* Install [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html).

Once the prerequisites are installed, simply navigate to any directory, modify the Vagrantfile and provisioning scripts if necessary, and run `vagrant up`. After a few minutes, your project should be ready to go!
